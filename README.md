# Automata-Driven Neural Network Model Compression

## Overview
This project introduces an **automata-driven pruning** technique for neural network compression, providing a dynamic and adaptive approach to reduce model size and computational requirements while maintaining performance. The method uses memory-based automata mechanisms to prune insignificant weights effectively.

## Key Features
- **Automata-Based Pruning:** Adaptive pruning decisions using automata states, ensuring stability and preventing over-pruning.
- **Model Efficiency:** Reduces model size and computational cost for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
- **Integration Potential:** Combines well with other compression techniques like quantization and knowledge distillation.

## Methodology
1. **Pruning Mechanism:**
   - Automata monitor the magnitude of weights during training.
   - Weights below a threshold for a defined memory depth are pruned.
   - Automata states ensure adaptive pruning without significant performance loss.

2. **Evaluation:**
   - Performance evaluated on benchmark datasets using metrics like accuracy and model size.
   - Comparison between pruned and unpruned models highlights the methodâ€™s effectiveness.

## Results
- **Accuracy Retention:** Maintains comparable accuracy to the unpruned model.
- **Compression Efficiency:** Significant reduction in model size and computational overhead.
- **Deployment Suitability:** Ideal for edge devices and resource-constrained environments.

## Future Directions
- **Improved Automata Models:** Introducing probabilistic and multi-state automata for enhanced adaptability.
- **Generalization:** Extending the approach to architectures like CNNs, RNNs, and transformers.
- **Technique Integration:** Combining pruning with quantization and knowledge distillation for higher compression rates.
